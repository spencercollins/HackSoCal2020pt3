Eventful website: developed by Spencer Collins, Aidan Hyman, Sophia Anderson
and Colin Russell. The site is a way to manage event invitations and make sure
guests stay informed.
The site allows users to plan multiple events, invite people
and determine important event data
Important note:
E-ventful has been tuned as far possible towards send invitees  emails of
invites for their events, however this feature is a paid firebase feature so
it has been omitted and replaced with a small paragraph restating why there
is an empty portion
the lack of email compatibility was discovered very late into project
development so we got as close as possible
